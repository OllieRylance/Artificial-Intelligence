*binary number of with 1 representing that input is used and 0 representing that it is not (in order), i.e., 1111111 means all inputs are used, 1100000 means only AREA and BFIHOST are inputs*,
*number of hidden layers, i.e., 1*,
(*number of hidden nodes in hidden layer 1, i.e., 8*, *(if exists) number of hidden nodes in hidden layer n, i.e., 6*),
(*activation function for hidden layer 1, i.e., sigmoid or tanh*, *(if exists) activation function for hidden layer n, i.e., sigmoid or tanh, activation function for output layer n, i.e., sigmoid or tanh*),
*number of output nodes, i.e., 1*,
